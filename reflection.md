Reflection is a key activity of learning. It helps you build a strong metacognition, or "understanding of your own learning." A good learner not only "knows what they know", but they "know what they don't know", too. Learning to reflect takes practice, but if your goal is to become a self-directed learner where you can teach yourself things, reflection is imperative.

- Now that you've completed the assignment, share your throughts. What did you learn? What confuses you? Where did you struggle? Where might you need more practice?
- A good reflection is: **specific as possible**,  **uses the terminology of the problem domain** (what was learned in class / through readings), and **is actionable** (you can pursue next steps, or be aided in the pursuit). That last part is what will make you a self-directed learner.
- Flex your recall muscles. You might have to review class notes / assigned readings to write your reflection and get the terminology correct.
- Your reflection is for **you**. Yes I make you write them and I read them, but you are merely practicing to become a better self-directed learner. If you read your reflection 1 week later, does what you wrote advance your learning?

Examples:

- **Poor Reflection:**  "I don't understand loops."   
**Better Reflection:** "I don't undersand how the while loop exits."   
**Best Reflection:** "I struggle writing the proper exit conditions on a while loop." It's actionable: You can practice this, google it, ask Chat GPT to explain it, etc. 
-  **Poor Reflection** "I learned loops."   
**Better Reflection** "I learned how to write while loops and their difference from for loops."   
**Best Reflection** "I learned when to use while vs for loops. While loops are for sentiel-controlled values (waiting for a condition to occur), vs for loops are for iterating over collections of fixed values."

This was a great way to apply pandas and Streamlit to build an interactive dataset browser. It challenged me to handle different data types, user interactions, and dynamic filtering efficiently. I learned how to use pandas for data manipulation, retrieve column names, filter data types, and extract unique values, as well as how to integrate Streamlit to create a user-friendly interface for loading, filtering, and displaying datasets. One challenge I faced was understanding Streamlit’s state management and ensuring the UI updated correctly when filters were applied. Handling different file formats (CSV, JSON, XLSX) also required careful parsing and debugging. Additionally, implementing dynamic column and row filtering took trial and error to get the dropdowns to update based on available values. Moving forward, I want to improve my understanding of Streamlit’s interactivity, optimize performance for large datasets, and enhance error handling in load_file(). Overall, this assignment strengthened my pandas skills and introduced me to building interactive data apps, giving me confidence in working with real-world datasets while also sparking curiosity about Streamlit’s more advanced capabilities.
